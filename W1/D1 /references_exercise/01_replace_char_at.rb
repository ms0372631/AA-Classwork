# Write a method, replace_char_at!(str, char, idx), that accepts a string, character, and an index as arguments. 
# The method should mutate the str by replacing the given idx of the str with the char. The method
# should return the str.
# 
# Note: this method must MUTATE the input str. This means that the object_id of the input string should be identical
# to the object_id of the returned string. The exact object_ids you get back don't matter. We just want the ids
# to be the same before and after calling your method.
