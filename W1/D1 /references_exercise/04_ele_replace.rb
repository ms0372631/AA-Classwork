# Write a method, ele_replace!(array, hash), that accepts an array and a hash as args.
# The method should mutate the given array by replacing elements with their corresponding values in the hash.
# The method should return the given array.
#
# Note: this method must MUTATE the input array. This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical
# to the object_id of the returned array. The exact object_ids you get back don't matter. We just want the ids
# to be the same before and after calling your method.
