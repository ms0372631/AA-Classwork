  def overlapping_requests
    # ======================================
    #
    # Ranges can overlap in several ways:
    #
    #   |-----|       |-----|     |---|
    #       |-----|   |-----|   |-------|
    #     (2x)                    (2x)
    #
    # ======================================
    #
    # However, it is easier to think of the
    # two cases where they do not overlap:
    #
    #    [Case 1]
    #
    #        A              B
    #    |-------|      |-------|
    #    A(s)    A(e)   B(s)    B(e)
    #
    # The start point of B comes after the
    # end point of A. Thus: B(s) > A(e)
    #
    #
    #    [Case 2]
    #
    #        B              A
    #    |-------|      |-------|
    #    B(s)    B(e)   A(s)    A(e)
    #
    # The start point of A comes after the
    # end point of B. Thus: A(s) > B(e)
    #
    # ======================================
    #
    # Taking those two cases, we can say
    # there's no overlap when:
    #
    #   B(s) > A(e) || A(s) > B(e)
    #
    # ======================================
    #
    # We can negate this to get all cases
    # where there must be overlap:
    #
    #   !( B(s) > A(e) || A(s) > B(e) )
    #
    # Personally, I find this most clear.
    #
    # In order for overlap to occur, the
    # other range cannot be entirely before
    # it or entirely after it.
    #
    # ======================================
    #
    # You could distribute the negation:
    #
    #   !( B(s) > A(e) ) && !( A(s) > B(e) )
    #
    # And take it even further, making it
    # shorter, but perhaps less intuitive:
    #
    #   B(s) <= A(e) && A(s) <= B(e)
    #
    # ======================================

    # We want:
    # 1. A different request
    # 2. That is for the same cat.
    # 3. That overlaps.
